Hi, I'm Krishnendu Marathe.
A Linux Enthusiast and obssessed with command line interface.
I love Linux, C and C++ programming Language, and Python if I feel lazy.

I enjoy building stuff from ground up. I created this account to upload whatever I can do to contribute (Starting from my First Year at University).
Looking forward to learning more stuff.
See ya!
